Fitsync is a python app that syncs data between Fitbit and Google Fit.

Currently, it only copies weight data from Fitbit to Google.

## Setup

### Environment

Use `virtualenv` to create an environment to install required packages,

    $ virtualenv env

Activate the environment in your shell,

    $ source env/bin/activate

Use `pip` to install the required packages,

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

### Fitbit Credentials

[Register a Fitbit application](https://dev.fitbit.com/apps/new). Note the client key and secret.

Run `auth_fitbit.py` to get credentials for read access to a user's data,

    $ python auth_fitbit.py [FITBIT CLIENT KEY] [FITBIT CLIENT SECRET] 

This scripts open a browser window where you can log in to your Fitbit account and authorize the app to "access your profile and data". When you accept, the site will give you a string to copy and paste back into the script, which then writes the credentials to a local file named `fitbit.yaml`.

### Google Credentials

[Create a project in Google Developers Console and enable the fitness API](https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=fitness). Create OAuth client ID with Other/Desktop type. Note the client id and client secret.

Run `auth_google.py` to get credentials for write access to a user's body data,

    $ python auth_google.py [GOOGLE CLIENT ID] [GOOGLE CLIENT SECRET] https://www.googleapis.com/auth/fitness.body.write

This script opens a browser window where you can log in to your Google account and authorize the app to "View and store body sensor data in Google Fit". When you accept, the script writes the credentials to a local file named `google.json`.

## Usage

Use the `patch` command to download data from Fitbit and upload to Google,

    $ python fitsync.py patch

Use the `delete` command to remove data from Google,

    $ python fitsync.py delete

Use the `get` command to see the data stored in Google,

    $ python fitsync.py get

There are a few options supported,

    $ python fitsync.py --help
